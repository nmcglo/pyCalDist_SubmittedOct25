TO DO:    c - complete    O - obsolete, see note
---------------------

[ ] - Save Logs to Disk
[ ] - Load Log on Boot if File exists
[c] - Add Arguments for specifying your own node ID on launch (zero indexed)
[c] - Fix One Indexed Stuff in Prompt
[c] - Message:
        <c> No Type
        <c> No Event
        <c> Yes TT
        <c> Yes PL
        <c> Yes sourceId
        <c> Yes destID
[c] - Prompt:
        <c> Handle add events with algorithm including sending of notifications to participants
                NOTE: I have commented out conflict resolution in the calendar Add event stuff
        <c> Handle delete events with algorithm including sending of notifications to participatns
[c] - Process.recvMsg():
        <c> Handle AlgorithmHelper usage
                NOTE: I have commented out outdated conflict resolution stuff here
[O] - ThreadedServer Send Message:
        <O> Handle AlgorithmHelper usage
                NOTE: AlgHelper adds messages to the queue, threadserver just looks at the queue
[c] - ThreadedServer import AlgHelper
                NOTE: I am doing the storage of the outQueue in the alghelper class. Referenced globally from there
[ ] - ThreadedServer: FIX INTER MESSAGING - NOT CERTAIN WHAT'S WRONG
[ ] - Implement Conflict Resolution:
                NOTE: Look at local version of calendar - is there a conflict? Ask user to enter new stuff
                NOTE: On later learning of conflict - NIAB: New Is Always Better. New events take priority over old
                events, don't worry about sending back stuff about conflict, proceed forward but notify all participants
                of a delete event. THIS MAY BE BAD - EVENTS WITH OTHER PEOPLE MAY BE JUST TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM CUS
                SOMEONES AN ASSHOLE. CHECK FOR AUTHORIZATION.
